# Meteor-Svelte Todo App
![Page Demo](demo.png)
You can view the prototype at this [link](https://psong-todo.meteorapp.com/).

As a previous ToDo app introduced Svelte, the main novelty about this app was the use of meteor as a backend and deployment tool. One of the advantages of Meteor is its reactive UI. This concept presumes a rapid automatic change of the user interface with each change in data. For example, once somebody posts a comment under your article, you can see it immediately, without reloading the page. Additionally, the deployment process was relatively simple when using Meteor. Since Meteor is built with MongoDB handlers, there was no need to connect to the backend database through the MongoDB UI. Compared to the Firebase Svelte ToDo app, which required the creation of a Firestore database using the App Dashboard UI, Meteor was able to handle the creation and editing of the backend database with simple import statements.
